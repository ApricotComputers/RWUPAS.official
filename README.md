Ralph Wilcox University of the Performing Arts & Sciences

This GitHub community is composed of developers and basically the "nerds" for the Ralph Wilcox University of the Performing Arts and Sciences. I'll first share why we have RWUPAS. Many students around the world cannot afford to attend the top Universities, especially in America. We have reviewed the structures of these elite institutions and realized that offering a quality education is not that difficult. So, with AI, the latest digital tools. We can compose that online content and offer a digital platform for learners all over the world who want to focus on film and television, and generally the performing arts and sciences. This Github repo will help everyone understand the key points and objectives of the university's overall plan. 

This github repo. will not just focus on the business plans for Ralph Wilcox University of the Performing Arts and Sciences (RWUPAS). It includes sections that will focus on the tech. side. Since the University is open source and uses Sakai in addition to other online platforms. We will include these subsections within various areas of the master plan, here.

This will allow everyone in the community to create various projects and work with a distributed team of community developers who will then focus on the mission, core values, and unique aspects of RWUPAS.
